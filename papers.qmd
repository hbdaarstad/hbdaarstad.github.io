### Dissertation

My dissertation focuses on the intersection of criminal-electoral violence and gender with a specialized focus on Mexico. I explore the arch of the electoral process (candidate selection, the campaign, and post-election) to understand how criminal vilence impacts the electoral process and how gender shapes that experience.
