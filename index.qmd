### Bio

Hello and welcome! My name is Haley and I am a PhD Candidate in the political science department at [The University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/). I research electoral and criminal violence with a focus on gender and research methods. Specifically, I am interested in electoral and criminal violence and its gendered dimension, such as understanding how various forms of violence affect how women participate in the electoral process. Methodologically, I am interested in the use of causal inference and machine learning.

Other than academics, I was born and raised in California, and attended Oregon State University where I obtained a bachelors degree in Political Science and New Media Communications in 2021. In my free time, I enjoy trail riding, running and downhill and cross-country skiing. I also love playing any type of games with my friends. I am also a huge fan of Formula1, papaya are my colors.
