    "text": "Bio\nHello and welcome! My name is Haley and I am a PhD Candidate in the political science department at The University of California, Davis. I research electoral and criminal violence with a focus on gender and research methods. Specifically, I am interested in electoral and criminal violence and its gendered dimension, such as understanding how various forms of violence affect how women participate in the electoral process. Methodologically, I am interested in the use of causal inference and machine learning.\nOther than academics, I was born and raised in California, and attended Oregon State University where I obtained a bachelors degree in Political Science and New Media Communications in 2021. In my free time, I enjoy trail riding, running and downhill and cross-country skiing. I also love playing any type of games with my friends. I am also a huge fan of Formula1, papaya are my colors.\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nðŸŽ“ PhD in Political Science, expected 2026 | University of California, Davis\n\n\nðŸŽ“ BS in Political Science, 2021 | Oregon State University\n\n\nðŸŽ“ BS in New Media Communications, 2021 | Oregon State University\n\n\n\n\nResearch interests\nElectoral Violence | Criminal Violence | Gender"
