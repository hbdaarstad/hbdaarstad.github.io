My work is broadly focused on understanding violence and its consequences and effects on behaviors. My dissertation is examining electoral and criminal violence and its gendered dimension, such as understanding how various forms of violence affect how women participate in the electoral process. I draw on causal inference, machine learning techniques, and qualitative interviews. I have received funding from the APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant for my dissertation. Beyond my dissertation, I also research and have on going projects working on conflict, peace, and extralegal violence.\nI was born and raised in California, and attended Oregon State University where I obtained a bachelors degree in Political Science and New Media Communications in 2021. In my free time, I enjoy trail riding, running and downhill and cross-country skiing.

    "text": "Dissertation\nSince the start of Mexico’s drug war in 2006, thousands have been killed by Organized Criminal Groups. Part of this violence is the rise of criminal-electoral violence— election violence by criminal organizations to manipulate the electoral outcome— which threatens democratic institutions and electoral systems. However, little research has looked at its consequences on the electoral system throughout the whole election arch and its impact on women and men differently. My project aims to address these gaps by reviewing criminal-electoral violence’s impact at each stage (candidate selection, the campaign, and post-election) and how gender shapes this experience so we can better understand the dynamics of criminal violence and what it means for the health of democratic institutions and elections. First, I explore how criminal-electoral violence influences who political parties select to run as candidates in Mexico and its impact on women candidates. Then, I break down how criminal organizations may change their behavior depending on the gender of a candidate they are trying to target. The final paper examines how gender differences among mayors may influence the level of criminal violence and perceptions of security in their communities. Ultimately, by addressing the impact of criminal-electoral violence on women participating in politics and the whole arch of the electoral process, my project contributes to a more thorough understanding of the consequences of criminal violence and its impact on the health and stability of democratic institutions and electoral systems. My dissertation is part of a broader research agenda that explores the intersections of gender, violence, and crime, with a strong emphasis on the use of advanced statistical methods.\nChair: Lauren Young (Associate Professor, UCD)\nCommittee Members: Sandra Ley (Distinguished Professor, ITESM), Juan Tellez (Associate Professor, UCD), and Hanno Hilbig (Assistant Professor, UCD)\n\n\nPublications\nDaarstad, Haley, RyuGyung Park, and Timea Balogh. 2023.
