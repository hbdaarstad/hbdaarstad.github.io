Hello!

My name is Haley and I am a PhD Candidate in the political science department at [The University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/) studying electoral and criminal violence. My work is broadly focused on understanding violence and its consequences and effects on behaviors. My dissertation is examining electoral and criminal violence and its gendered dimension, such as understanding how various forms of violence affect how women participate in the electoral process. Methodologically, I am interested in the use of causal inference and machine learning. I am also a recipient of APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant. 

I was born and raised in California, and attended Oregon State University where I obtained a bachelors degree in Political Science and New Media Communications in 2021. In my free time, I enjoy trail riding, running and downhill and cross-country skiing. I am also a huge fan of Formula1 (papaya are my colors).
