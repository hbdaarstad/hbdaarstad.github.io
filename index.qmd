Hello!

My name is Haley and I am a PhD Candidate in the political science department at [The University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/) studying criminal violence. My work is broadly focused on understanding violence and its consequences and effects on behaviors. My dissertation is examining electoral and criminal violence and its gendered dimension, such as understanding how various forms of violence affect how women participate in the electoral process. I draw on causal inference, machine learning techniques, and qualitative interviews. I have received funding from the APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant for my dissertation. Beyond my dissertation, I also research and have on going projects working on conflict, peace, and extralegal violence. 

I was born and raised in California, and attended Oregon State University where I obtained a bachelors degree in Political Science and New Media Communications in 2021. In my free time, I enjoy trail riding, running and downhill and cross-country skiing. I am also a huge fan of Formula1 (papaya are my colors).
